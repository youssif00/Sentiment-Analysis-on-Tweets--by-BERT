A deep learning project that performs sentiment analysis on tweets using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. This project classifies tweets into 6 different emotions: sadness, joy, love, anger, fear, and surprise.

## Overview

This project uses the BERT model to perform multi-class sentiment analysis on tweets. The model is fine-tuned on the DAIR-AI emotion dataset to classify tweets into six different emotional categories. The implementation uses the Hugging Face `transformers` library and PyTorch.
